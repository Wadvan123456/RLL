## Results Achieved

After completing the deployment and running the Reinforcement Learning system on AWS, the following key results were obtained:

### 1. RL Model Training Outcomes

- **Successful training of the RL model on EC2 instances with high efficiency:**  
  The model leveraged GPU-enabled EC2 instances (e.g., `p3`, `g4dn`) to accelerate the training process, significantly reducing training time compared to standard servers.

- **Real-time training monitoring via AWS CloudWatch:**  
  - Metrics such as **average reward**, **loss function**, and **training steps** are recorded in real time.  
  - You can visualize these metrics on CloudWatch dashboards to track training progress and detect issues early.

- **Automated model versioning and storage on Amazon S3:**  
  Each trained model version is automatically uploaded to a configured S3 bucket, enabling:  
  - Easy management of model versions.  
  - Efficient model recovery and rollback.  
  - Seamless deployment and sharing of models across systems.

### 2. Automation of Operational Workflows

- **Event-driven AWS Lambda functions:**  
  Lambda functions are triggered automatically by events such as new model uploads to S3 or training completion notifications. This facilitates:  
  - Post-processing tasks like model quality checks.  
  - Sending notifications via email, Slack, or SMS.  
  - Triggering subsequent CI/CD pipeline stages.

- **EventBridge and CloudWatch Alarms:**  
  - Automated monitoring of AWS resource health with alerts and remediation triggers.  
  - Ensures continuous system operation and minimizes downtime.

### 3. Enhanced Security and Access Management

- **IAM roles and policies implemented following the principle of least privilege:**  
  - All AWS components (EC2, Lambda, S3, etc.) have only the minimum permissions necessary to operate.  
  - This reduces security risks from leaked credentials or attacks.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  
  - Adds a second layer of protection to AWS admin accounts, preventing unauthorized access.

- **Comprehensive audit logs with CloudTrail:**  
  - All access and configuration changes are recorded, aiding in security monitoring and incident investigation.

| Epoch | Average Reward | Loss  | Training Time (minutes) |
|-------|----------------|-------|------------------------|
| 1     | 10.5           | 0.45  | 15                     |
| 10    | 23.7           | 0.20  | 150                    |
| 50    | 45.9           | 0.08  | 750                    |

### 5. Practical Benefits

- **Accelerated model development and experimentation:**  
  AWS enables fast deployment with easy scalability to match resource needs.

- **Stable and secure operations:**  
  Centralized architecture with strong security and automated alerts reduces risks.

- **Easy integration and extensibility:**  
  Components like Lambda, S3, and EventBridge enable building complex, automated pipelines end-to-end.
