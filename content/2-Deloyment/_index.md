# Deployment

Deploying a Reinforcement Learning (RL) system on AWS involves setting up and configuring several core cloud resources to provide a secure, scalable, and efficient environment for model training and inference.

## Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) {#create-a-virtual-private-cloud-vpc}

- Set up a dedicated VPC to isolate your RL infrastructure.
- Configure subnets, route tables, and internet gateways to enable secure communication.
- Use Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Security Groups to restrict traffic and protect resources.

## Configure Identity and Access Management (IAM) {#configure-identity-and-access-management-iam}

- Create IAM roles with least privilege permissions for EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and other services.
- Define IAM policies to secure access to resources like S3 buckets and Elastic Compute resources.
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive accounts.

## Launch EC2 Instances {#launch-ec2-instances}

- Select appropriate instance types (e.g., GPU-enabled instances) for RL training workloads.
- Use Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) with pre-installed ML frameworks or configure them manually.
- Set up SSH access securely and configure monitoring and logging.

## Set up AWS Lambda Functions {#set-up-aws-lambda-functions}

- Create Lambda functions to automate workflow tasks such as:
  - Triggering training jobs.
  - Processing training results.
  - Managing model deployments.
- Use event sources such as S3 object uploads or CloudWatch events to invoke Lambda functions.

## Configure Amazon S3 Buckets {#configure-amazon-s3-buckets}

- Create S3 buckets to store datasets, training results, and model artifacts.
- Enable versioning and lifecycle policies to manage data retention and cost.
- Set up bucket policies to control access.
