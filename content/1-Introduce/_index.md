# Introduction

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with their environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not require labeled datasets but instead learns optimal policies through trial and error, which makes it highly applicable in complex, dynamic environments such as robotics, gaming, autonomous driving, and resource management.

Deploying RL solutions at scale poses several challenges:

- **Computational demands:** Training RL models requires significant compute power, often necessitating distributed and parallel processing.
- **Dynamic workflows:** RL training pipelines involve iterative evaluation, model updates, and data handling, requiring automation and orchestration.
- **Data management:** Large volumes of data and model checkpoints must be stored reliably and accessed efficiently.
- **Security and networking:** Protecting data and compute resources is essential, especially when working in cloud environments.
- **Scalability:** The system must flexibly scale up or down based on workload demands to optimize costs and performance.

AWS provides a powerful ecosystem of cloud services that effectively address these challenges. This workshop focuses on using key AWS services to build a robust and scalable RL infrastructure:

- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** Provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud, enabling the deployment of GPU-enabled instances for intensive RL training workloads.
- **AWS Lambda:** A serverless compute service that automates parts of the RL workflow by running code in response to events, reducing operational overhead.
- **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Enables the creation of isolated, secure network environments where RL components can communicate safely.
- **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Controls access to AWS resources with fine-grained permissions, ensuring security and compliance.
- **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Offers durable and scalable storage for datasets, trained models, logs, and results.

Throughout this workshop, you will learn how to provision and configure these services, integrate them into a cohesive RL system, and apply best practices for security and cost management. By the end, you will have a solid foundation for deploying scalable and maintainable RL workloads on AWS.
